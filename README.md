Design Pillars:

I. Consequences are big.
	Players should feel like their actions are changing and warping the world around them.

II. Your Past Will Haunt You.
	Every action and choice of meaning a player makes must have a consequence.


Gameplay Flow:

1. Intro

	The intro is designed to ease the player into the game. It opens with a gameplay and narrative Hook to pull players into the game. 
It follows by teaching them all the fundamental building blocks they need to complete the challenges presented throughout the game.

	a. Character Select
	b. Introductory Sequence

2. Act One

	Section one is designed to show the player the extent of what is possible with the games mechanics without challenging them too 
much. Consequences from actions in this section should not hamstring future play.

3. Act Two

	Section two is designed to test the players skills more heavily. This is where the difficulty should be amped up and players get
more freedom to express themselves through gameplay than before.

4. Act Three

	Section three is where the player is given the most freedom to play and experiment with the games systems. In section three player
are given ample oppurtunity to test their skills, although the core route remains playable for the below average player.

5. Final Sequence

	The Final Sequence is designed to be a full test of all the skills the player has accumulated throughout play, although the gameplay 
does not need to be overly difficult. It is where the player finally understands the full consequences of their choices.
